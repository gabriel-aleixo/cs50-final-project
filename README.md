*Same bad frozen pizza twice...* üòñ
*Never again!* ü•∂üçïüôå

## Introduction

### Video Demo: [PizzaYeah9 demo (soon)](https://)

### Description

There are way too many varieties of frozen pizza in your average grocery store. They usually all look the same, with their italian-sounding names, their nice pictures of red ripe tomatoes, fresh basil, and melted cheese.
However, they most certainly do not taste the same! We know good frozen pizza from bad frozen pizza when we eat it, right?
But how can we remember and keep track of the ones we bought before and liked, versus the ones we should steer away from?
This is why I built this app.
You simply take a snapshot of a pizza's box and select "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether you would buy it again or not.
The next time you're in the supermarket, and you can't remember if you had that particular forzen pizza before, just take a snapshot of the package and the app will show you all the similar pizzas you had, which were Yesses, and which were Noes.

### Background

This is my final project for the Harvard CS50x course I took this year. I wanted to build something that would allow me to learn and use new technologies, go through all the step of planning, designing and building a product, and at the same, tackle a consequential and meaningful challenge affecting the lives of many people.
That last part ended up meaning tackling a funny and silly problem affecting the lives of at least two people, my wife and I. But that seems good enough for me!
